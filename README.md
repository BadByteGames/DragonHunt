# DragonHunt
DragonHunt is a text adventure engine developed in c++ based around XML. The engine uses the tinyXML2 library as well as EasyCMD which is also devolped on this repository for the sake of testing.

## Development
Dragon hunt is developed in Visual Sudio 2017 by armedturret.

MacOS testing is done by ZedLeppin.
Note: MacOS is currently not supported but the could change

The project is also occasionally tested with a Makefile using g++.

## Improvements
The engine is still in early development altough we would like to convert  from using winhttp to something more cross platform such as libcurl.

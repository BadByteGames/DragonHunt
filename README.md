MacOS testing is done by ZedLeppin.

To build the project simply generate it with CMake. A stable internet connection is required for hunter to fetch the required packages. Please report an bugs in issues.

## Contributing

If you can figure out a cross platform way to get the contents of an https site, please contact me. The option should be easily buildable with CMake and not require downloads of other languages (i.e OpenSSL needs PERL).
